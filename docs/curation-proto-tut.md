# Cellxgene Curation Tutorial

CELLXGENE LOGO GOES HERE

## Introduction
purpose: Motivate submission to the data portal give context

Cellxgene's publishing platform and interactive single cell data explorer is a system which is optimized for easy access, interrogation and sharing/reuse of single cell data. In order to meet these standards and to facilitate easy navigation/aggregation among the growing number of single cell datasets, the cellxgene publishing platform currently accepts curated anndata objects adhering to a [comprehensive data schema (@TODO add link)](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/single-cell-curation/main/docs/corpora_schema.md). 

In this tutorial, you will gain all the essential information for doing the following: 
- curating one of your own single cell datasets in a streamlined manner
- uploading data in the cellxgene data portal
- navigating the portal and ensuring public or private access to your datasets
- basic data exploration in the cellxgene explorer view

Beyond this we hope that you see the value of using this portal as a publishing platform and also welcome any comments that pertain improving the portal and curation experience. You can contact us via [support email]()

## Anndata object structure

- Talk about object structure
- limitations 
- what are the features/aspects of the anndata object that cellxgene data portal expects (essential slots/entries in the anndata object) - talk about where schema information is stored



## Accepted data types

Talk about the data types that we are able to support (it is mostly ambiguous, but anndata does have some limitations that can be talk about here)

Guidelines for:
- ATAC/mC
- RNAseq
- CITEseq
- Spatial/Visium
